👋 Hello World!  I'm Souleymane, an AWS Community Builder and passionate DevOps engineer with a love for automation, continuous improvement and cloud storage. 🚀

🔧 I enjoy working at the intersection of development and operations, automating processes, and optimizing workflows to deliver high-quality software faster.

🛠️ My tech stack includes tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Ansible, Terraform, and AWS. I'm always exploring new technologies to stay on top of the ever-evolving DevOps landscape.

🌱 Currently, I'm focusing on honing my skills in infrastructure as code (IaC), security best practices, and leveraging cloud-native technologies for scalable and resilient applications.

👨‍💻 When I'm not crafting infrastructure solutions, you can find me contributing to open-source projects, tinkering with side projects, or sharing my knowledge through blog posts and tech meetups.

📫 Let's connect! Feel free to reach out for collaboration, discussions, or anything DevOps or cloud storage related
